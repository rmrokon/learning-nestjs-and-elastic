# ðŸ“˜ Day 1 â€“ NestJS Fundamentals

Today I started learning **NestJS** from scratch and built my first basic module.

## âœ… What I Learned

- Set up a new NestJS project using **Yarn**.
- Understood the roles of **modules**, **controllers**, and **services**.
- Learned key **OOP concepts** like encapsulation and dependency injection.
- Explored how **decorators** work (e.g., `@Controller`, `@Get`, `@Injectable`).
- Created my own module `StatusModule` with a `GET /status` endpoint.
- Injected a `StatusService` into the controller to separate logic cleanly.
